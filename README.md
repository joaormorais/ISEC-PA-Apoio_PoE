# ISEC-PD-Apoio_PoE

I was given a project to develop a Java-based application to support the management of projects and internships for the Department of Computer and Systems Engineering at ISEC. 

The application is designed to be fed with different types of data depending on the current phase of the management process: 
(1) proposal collection, 
(2) student ranking for internships and projects, 
(3) student submissions for preferred projects and internships, 
(4) information about the supervisors for each project or internship. 

User interfaces allow for manual input and data to be imported from CSV files. 

The source code has a clear separation between the model and user interface, the model contains no user interaction and the user interface contains no business logic. The project is organized into packages and follows the State design pattern, utilizing a polymorphic approach. Various distinct phases of the project and internship management process are taken into account, each offering a specific set of features.

# My personal analysis of the project

I enjoyed working on this project a lot. Prior to this, I had mostly worked with C and C++, but working with Java for the first time was an amazing experience. Now, it's my favorite language. Almost every feature was accomplished and I am extremely satisfied with my work. It was one of the best projects that I have completed as a student.
